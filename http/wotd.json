This paddle was eventually known in English as a \"slapstick,\" and it became a symbol of that type of highly physical comedy. The word \"slapstick\" then came to refer to the comedy itself.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.</p>", "examples": "<p>Joe's sense of humor was such that the slapstick of the Three Stooges would have him rolling on the floor.</p>", "func": "noun", "date": "2006/12/30", "audio": "slapst01.wav", "def": [["<strong>:</strong> a device made of two flat pieces of wood fastened at one end so as to make a loud noise when used by an actor to strike a person"], ["<strong>:</strong> comedy stressing farce and horseplay; <em>also</em> <strong>:</strong> activity resembling slapstick"]]}, {"word": "chagrin", "pron": "\\shuh-GRIN\\", "etymology": "<p>\"Chagrin\" comes from French, in which it means \"grief,\" \"sorrow,\" or essentially the same thing as our \"chagrin,\" and in which it is also an adjective meaning \"sad.\" Some etymologists have linked this \"chagrin\" with another French \"chagrin,\" meaning \"rough leather\" or \"rough skin.\" Supposedly, the rough leather used to rub, polish, or file became a metaphor in French for agitating situations.

We've used both \"lieu\" itself (meaning \"place\" or \"stead,\" as in \"in lieu of\") and \"lieutenant\" since the 14th century.</p>", "examples": "<p>The quiet suburban neighborhood was within walking distance of the elementary school and provided the perfect milieu for raising a family.</p>", "func": "noun", "date": "2007/03/17", "audio": "milieu02.wav", "def": [["<strong>:</strong> the physical or social setting in which something occurs or develops <strong>:</strong> environment"]]}, {"word": "sinuous", "pron": "\\SIN-yuh-wus\\", "etymology": "<p>Although it probably makes you think more of snakes than head colds, \"sinuous\" is etymologically more like \"sinus\" than \"serpent.\" \"Sinuous\" and \"sinus\" both derive from the Latin noun \"sinus,\" which means \"curve, fold, or hollow.\" Other \"sinus\" descendents include \"insinuate\" (\"to impart or suggest in an artful or indirect way\") and two terms you might remember from math class: \"sine\" and \"cosine.\" In English, \"sinus\" is the oldest of these words; it entered the language in the 1400s. \"Insinuate\" appeared next, in 1529, and was followed by \"sinuous\" (1578), \"sine\" (1593), and \"cosine\" (1635). \"Serpent,\" by the way, entered English in the 13th century and comes from the Latin verb \"serpere,\" meaning \"to creep.\"\r\n\r\n<br /><br />*Indicates the sense illustrated by the example sentence.</p>", "examples": "<p>While flying over the Midwest, I saw a long, sinuous river that wound through fields, farms, and towns as it made its way towards the Gulf of Mexico.</p>", "func": "adjective", "date": "2007/03/18", "audio": "sinuou01.wav", "def": [["<em class=\"sn\">a</em> <strong>:</strong> of a serpentine or wavy form <strong>:</strong> winding", "<span class=\"break\"> </span><em class=\"sn\">b</em> <strong>:</strong> marked by strong lithe movements"], ["<strong>:</strong> intricate, complex"]]}, {"word": "ablution", "pron": "\\uh-BLOO-shun\\", "etymology": "<p>\"Ablution\" derives via Middle French and Middle English from the Latin verb \"abluere,\" meaning \"to wash away,\" formed from the prefix \"ab-\" (\"away, off\") and \"lavere\" (\"to wash\").

Therein lies a lexical connection between \"art\" and \"artifice.\" \"Artifice\" derives from \"artificium,\" Latin for \"artifice\" (that root also gave English \"artificial\"). \"Artificium\" in turn developed from \"ars,\" the Latin root underlying the word \"art\" (and related terms such as \"artist\" and \"artisan\").\r\n\r\n</p>", "examples": "<p>\"When it comes to beauty and fashion, it's all about artifice and deception&#133;.

Today, the \"steeping\" and \"soaking\" senses of \"macerate\" saturate culinary articles (as in \"macerating fruit in liquor\") as well as other writings (scientific ones, for instance: \"the food is macerated in the gizzard\" or \"the wood is macerated in the solution\").\r\n\r\n</p>", "examples": "<p>\"Absinthe is made by macerating herbs and spices, including anise and fennel, with the grand wormwood (<em>Artemisia absinthium</em>) that gives the drink its name.\" (Julia Reed, <em>Newsweek</em>, April 12, 2010)</p>", "func": "verb", "date": "2010/06/21", "audio": "macera01.wav", "def": [["<strong>:</strong> to cause to waste away by or as if by excessive fasting"], ["<strong>:</strong> to cause to become soft or separated into constituent elements by or as if by steeping in fluid; <em>broadly</em> <strong>:</strong> steep, soak"], ["<strong>:</strong> to soften and wear away especially as a result of being wetted or steeped"]]}, {"word": "abdicate", "pron": "\\AB-dih-kayt\\", "etymology": "<p>Give it up.

For example, a compact collection of enjoyably lighthearted short stories might be called \"a nosegay of a book.\"<br /><br />Name That Synonym: What synonym of \"nosegay\" rhymes with \"cozy\"? <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/posy\">The answer is ...</a></p>", "examples": "<p>The young man presented a <em>nosegay</em> of red, white, and yellow roses to his sweetheart.<br /><br />&#147;The bride carried a <em>nosegay</em> of green hydrangeas, Gerbera daisies, and coral roses hand-tied in turquoise ribbon.&#148; -- From a wedding announcement in <em>Mississippi Magazine</em>, January 2010</p>", "func": "noun", "date": "2010/12/25", "audio": "nosega01.wav", "def": [["<strong>:</strong> a small bunch of flowers"]]}, {"word": "embarrass", "pron": "\\im-BAIR-us\\", "etymology": "<p>If you've ever been so embarrassed that you felt like you were caught up in a noose of shame you may have some insight into the origins of the word \"embarrass.\" The word can be traced back through French and Spanish to the Portuguese word \"embara&#231;ar,\" which was itself probably formed as a combination of the prefix \"em-\" (from Latin \"in-\") and \"bara&#231;a,\" the Portuguese word for \"noose.\" Though \"embarrass\" has had various meanings throughout its history in English, these days it most often implies making someone feel or look foolish.<br /><br />Test Your Memory: What is the meaning of \"rectrix,\" our Word of the Day from December 8, 2010? <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/2010/12/08/\">The answer is ...</a></p>", "examples": "<p>She <em>embarrassed</em> her grandson by showing his baby pictures to his friends.<br /><br />\"She wasn't about to <em>embarrass</em> herself in front of a man she hardly knew.

It was that ragtag \"raff\" that gave rise to the adjective \"raffish\" in the late 1700s.<br /><br />Test Your Vocabulary: In his book <em>The South Seas</em>, Robert Louis Stevenson wrote, \"I had met the man before this in the village, and detested him on sight; there was something indescribably raffish in his looks and ways that raised my gorge&#133;.\" What is the meaning of \"gorge\"? <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gorge\">The answer is ...</a></p>", "examples": "<p>Gina often seemed to be attracted to the <em>raffish</em> and rebellious boys, rather than the quiet intellectuals in her classes.<br /><br />\"They rode a bus a few stops and got off in the <em>raffish</em> suburb of Chelsea, a low-rent neighborhood of artists and writers.\" -- From Ken Follett's 2010 novel <em>Fall of Giants</em></p>", "func": "adjective", "date": "2011/03/04", "audio": "raffis01.wav", "def": [["<strong>:</strong> marked by or suggestive of flashy vulgarity or crudeness"], ["<strong>:</strong> marked by a careless unconventionality <strong>:</strong> rakish"]]}, {"word": "volte-face", "pron": "\\vawlt-FAHSS\\", "etymology": "<p>\"Volte-face\" came to English by way of French from Italian \"voltafaccia\" (from \"voltare,\" Italian for \"to turn,\" and \"faccia,\" meaning \"face\").

A toxin in wormwood -- perhaps the very chemical that gives the plant its tapeworm-exterminating properties (and thus its name).

Today \"coquet\" can refer to male or female flirts (though \"coquette,\" the French feminine form, is more commonly used for flirtatious women), and \"coquetry\" can refer to flirtation by men or women.<br /><br />Test Your Memory: What is the meaning of \"mountebank,\" our Word of the Day from November 16? <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/2011/11/16/\">The answer is &#133;</a></p>", "examples": "<p>In a not-so-subtle act of <em>coquetry</em>, Nancy smiled flirtatiously and winked at Scott as she walked past him.<br /><br />&#147;Her Act III solo with a fan became an expression not of conventional <em>coquetry</em> but of impish joy in the moment.\" -- From a review of the American Ballet Theater in <em>The New York Times</em>, May 25, 2011</p>", "func": "noun", "date": "2011/11/28", "audio": "coquet04.wav", "def": [["<strong>:</strong> a flirtatious act or attitude"]]}, {"word": "regardless", "pron": "\\rih-GAHRD-lus\\", "etymology": "<p>\"Regardless\" is rather simply derived from the noun \"regard\" (meaning \"attention\" or \"concern\") plus \"-less\" -- nothing too shocking about that.

The meaning of \"conclave\" has also expanded to include gatherings that are not necessarily secret or private but simply involve people with shared interests.<br /><br />Test Your Memory: What recent Word of the Day means \"bad spelling\" or \"bad handwriting\"? <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/2012/02/07/\">The answer is ...</a></p>", "examples": "<p>\"The shadowy world of Ministers' meetings and security service <em>conclaves</em> ... was never explored.\" -- From an article by Mary Riddell in <em>The Observer</em>, February 2004<br /><br />\"On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Lin and other village leaders met to discuss their options and decided to call off the public protests and to reopen access to the village.&#133;\r\n After that <em>conclave</em>, the village leaders held a rally with more than 1,000 residents in a public square and told the audience about the new agreement.\" -- From an article by Edward Wong in <em>The New York Times</em>, December 22, 2011</p>", "func": "noun", "date": "2012/02/25", "audio": "concla01.wav", "def": [["<strong>:</strong> a private meeting or secret assembly"], ["<strong>:</strong> a gathering of a group or association"]]}, {"word": "empirical", "pron": "\\im-PEER-uh-kul\\", "etymology": "<p>When \"empirical\" first appeared as an adjective in English, it meant simply \"in the manner of an empiric.\" An empiric was a member of an ancient sect of doctors who practiced medicine based exclusively on experience, as contrasted with those who relied on theory or philosophy.
